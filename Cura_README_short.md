# Cura — Virtual Clinician Prototype

Cura is a simple virtual clinician designed to explore how AI can support calm, human-like conversations.  
It senses the user’s emotional tone, responds with short and warm messages, and changes its on‑screen facial expression to match the mood of the interaction.

Cura is *not* a medical tool — it is a research prototype used to study:
- emotionally aware AI conversations  
- realistic avatar reactions  
- how people respond to supportive AI communication  

The system uses:
- a changing clinician avatar that reacts to the flow of conversation  
- a friendly chat interface  
- local AI models (running privately on your computer)  

By blending expressions, tone, and simple emotional understanding, Cura aims to make digital interactions feel more human and supportive.
